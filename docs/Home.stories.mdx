# Hack The Valley UI Kit

React UI Library used across multiple applications for uniform styling and consistent code.

## Install

<br />

### Production

```
npm install @htv/ui-kit
```

> Note that the library is pre-compiled, hence you would have to include it in your
> webpack config for rules involving `.scss` and `.js`. Other dependencies (other
> than the obvious `sass` and `react`) involved are `classnames`, `prop-types`,
> `babel-plugin-dev-expression`. (Refer to the peer-dependencies)

> This is also built following React 17, hence your jsx babel preset/plugin needs to
> be using `runtime: "automatic"` for this to work.

### Development

1. `git clone git+https://github.com/hackthevalley/hack-the-ui.git`
2. `npm ci # For install if thats what you're into`
3. `npm start`

> Perhaps in the future we can look into something similar to electron with a two
> package.json setup to help with better package filtered (npm needs to step up >:c)
